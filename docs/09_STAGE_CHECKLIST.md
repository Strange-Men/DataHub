# DataHub Stage Checklist

Use this checklist before every development stage.

## 1. Required Reading

Before starting work, read:

- `docs/00_PROJECT_SCOPE.md`
- `docs/01_IDEA_PRESSURE_TEST.md`
- `docs/02_PRD.md`
- `docs/03_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/04_API_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/05_DEV_RULES.md`
- `docs/06_TECH_STACK_CANDIDATES.md`
- `docs/07_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`
- `docs/08_DEV_STATUS.md`
- `docs/09_STAGE_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/10_FINAL_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md`

## 2. Stage Declaration

Before editing files, state:

- Current milestone.
- Allowed work.
- Forbidden work.
- Expected files to modify.
- Whether the work violates existing project boundaries.

## 3. Scope Check

Confirm:

- The task belongs to the current milestone.
- The task is small enough for one development round.
- The task does not implement future extension points early.
- The task does not change API contracts without updating documentation.
- The task does not introduce unnecessary infrastructure.

## 4. Safety Check

Confirm:

- No real customer private data is committed.
- No API keys or secrets are committed.
- `.env` files are ignored.
- Logs do not expose private data.
- Raw data, sanitized data, drafts, approved knowledge, RAG index, and Bad Cases remain logically separated once implemented.

## 5. CustomerOpsAgent Boundary Check

Confirm:

- CustomerOpsAgent only uses DataHub APIs.
- CustomerOpsAgent does not access the database directly.
- CustomerOpsAgent does not modify knowledge directly.
- CustomerOpsAgent does not retrieve raw data or unapproved drafts.

## 6. Technology Decision Check

Confirmed stack:

- React + TypeScript frontend.
- FastAPI + Python backend.

Do not finalize without explicit approval:

- Database.
- Vector database.
- ORM.
- RAG framework.
- Background task queue.
- Cloud deployment platform.

## 7. Verification Check

- The implemented work matches the milestone acceptance criteria.
